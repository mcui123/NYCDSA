# NYCDSA

This is a stock price and portfolio return visualization exercise, using the 
daily stock price of all companies listed on SP500 from Feb 2013 to Feb 2018. 


I will use Shiny to 
(1) Display historical stock price trend [Stock History]
(2) Showcase stock price estimation [Stock Forecast], and 
(3) Visualize portfolio return based on different weights and 5 stocks of choice [Portfolio Management] 


(2) Involves a bit of machine learning - currently picked linear regression, ARIMA, and SVB model (still need fine tuning as of 06.21.19)
